Preliminary results showed that when TraumaHawk was not used to communicate, doctors had about 12 minutes of lead-time to prepare for a crash victim. But, when TraumaHawk was used, that lead time was more than doubled, providing doctors with patient details and photos an average of 26 minutes before a crash victim arrived.</p>'
